🌾 KisanSetu - Water Intelligence
KisanSetu is a decision-support platform designed to empower the Indian farming community by transforming 30 years of historical groundwater data (1994–2024) into hyper-local, actionable insights. By analyzing water table depths (mbgl) at the village level, the application utilizes a modern, color-coded visual gauge and a "Smart Crop Advisor" to help farmers identify if their local water source is depleting and provides critical recommendations—such as transitioning to drought-resistant millets or adopting drip irrigation—to ensure sustainable and climate-resilient agricultural practices.
